Fractal is an organization that provides tutorials for topics related to artifical intelligence, is involved with educational outreach such as giving talks at local schools, and other charitable outreach programs.

More recently we have been working on disaster relief efforts in the Atlanta area for families affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, we are focusing much of out efforts of providing donated food and educational supplies to families in need.
