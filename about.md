<p align="justify">Fractal is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing computer science education among young students and supporting underrepresented groups in computer science. We do this by writing guides for both introductory topics in computer science, targeting mostly high school level students, and more advanced topics focused on artifical intellgience, primarily targeting undergraduate students. In additon to these guides, we collaborating with public schools to incorporate computer science into the classroom by creating simple projects and lesson plans that involve programming.</p>

<p align="justify">In the modern age, technology is becoming increasingly integrated with every area of society and consequently, teaching our students how to use this technology is useful for every industry. By creating interactive lessons and projects that incorporate programming into the pedagogy of other subjects, we are helping to prepare the next generation of professionals.</p>
