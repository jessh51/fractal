### Linear Approximation

Linear approximation is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and one that has a surprising amount of mathematical structure built around it for such a seemingly simple problem. Consider the following problem: We have a Hilbert space $\mathbf{S}$ and a subspace $\mathbf{T} \subseteq \mathbf{S}$. We also have an element $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{S}$. What is the closest element $\mathbf{\hat{x}} \in \mathbf{T}$ to $\mathbf{x}$?
