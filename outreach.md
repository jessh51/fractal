### Food and School Supplies Donations

Being home to one of the busiest airports in the world, Atlanta, like other major cities in the United States, has seen a surge in new cases of Covid-19, with some of the hardest hit counties also being some of the poorest in the metro-Atlanta area. The economic turmoil brought on by the loss of jobs and lack of local business only inflates the issue.

In response to this unprecedented outbreak, Fractal has been partnering with schools and other organizations to provide aid to families in needs in the Atlanta area. We are working hard to get much needed food and school supplies donations to those who need them most in these troubling times. If you would like to help donate much needed food or school supplies to our efforts, please reach out at mpiseno@gatech.edu.
